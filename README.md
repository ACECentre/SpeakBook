This is a repository to hold the working versions of [Patrick Joyce's SpeakBook project](https://web.archive.org/web/20170325172200/http://www.speakbook.org/). We aim to provide a platform for crowd-sourced version control of future PDF's here. More info (*and the current final releases*) can be found at the Ace Centre's project page [here](http://acecentre.org.uk/project/speakbook/).

The current *in-progress* versions (Note: will only look as intended in Chrome. We recommend looking at the PDF builds):

- ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§[English SpeakBook](/speakbook/), [Printing Instructions](/speakbook/printing-instructions.html) (and [PDF](/speakbook/index.pdf), [PDF - Printing Instructions](/speakbook/printing-instructions.pdf))
- ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ª[Swedish SpeakBook](/sv/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/sv/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹[Portuguese SpeakBook](/po/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/po/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸[Spanish SpeakBook](/es/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/es/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª[German SpeakBook](/de/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/de/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·[French SpeakBook](/fr/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/fr/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦[Afrikaans SpeakBook](/af/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/af/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡¿ðŸ‡¦[Zulu SpeakBook](/zu/speakbook/) (and [PDF](/zu/speakbook/index.pdf))
- ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·[Turkish Speakbook](/tr/speakbook/), [Printing Instructions](/tr/speakbook/printing-instructions.html) (and [PDF](/tr/speakbook/index.pdf), [PDF - Printing Instructions](/tr/speakbook/printing-instructions.pdf))

**Urgent needs**
- German need proofing and more work
- Zulu and Afrikkans need a maintainer - and proofer (currently google translated)
- Need translations for a [printed instructions sheet ](https://acecentre.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Printing-Instructions1.pdf)
- More serious coding issues see the queue [ here](https://github.com/acecentre/SpeakBook/issues).

## Technical Background

This is simply a Vue.js themed template with some scripts to generate a PDF of the html document that is created. Its designed for chrome as chrome does the PDF generation.  We use [PO language strings](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/PO-Files.html) in this project. On each markdown file we have a ``text:`` field where there is a list of strings available to the page. This means you can separate the design logic from the language information. We have some scripts to aid this process. A Markdown->PO script to create a PO file from a file - and then a PO->Markdown script that applies new language strings to a markdown file.  

### Layout

    .vuepress/
        build-pdf-plugin.js    <-  The pdf build plugin. 
        config.js
        dist/                  <- Where the final build is outputted
        public/                <- Static assets like images sit here and in SpeakBook/
        theme/  
            layouts/
                SpeakBook.vue  <- The main logic for SpeakBook
            styles/
            util/
            fonts/
            components/         

    .scripts/
        common.js
        apply-po-to-md.js     <- Apply a PO Language file to Markdown file. 
        getPOfiles.js         <- NOT WORKING - Grab files from POEditor
        po-from-md.js         <- Make a master PO file from a markdown file.        

    speakbook/
        README.md             <- The English version of SpeakBook

    lang/speakbook/
        README.md             <- Other language versions

### Package scripts

```
# run a local server for development
$ yarn dev
# build it in static html format
$ yarn build
# build pdf format for all pages
$ yarn buildpdf
```

### Language translation scripts

1. Export your PO file from POEditor
2. Convert your language file with the correct strings. e.g. 
```node .scripts/apply-po-to-md.js res/lang/Swedish.po speakbook/README.md > sv/speakbook/README.md```
3. Done!

If you need to make a new POEditor file of terms run
```node .scripts/po-from-md.js speakbook/README.md > res/master.po```


### Script to update all files from POEditor

```
node .scripts/apply-po-to-md.js res/lang/SpeakBook_Spanish.po es/speakbook/README.md > es/speakbook/README2.md && mv es/speakbook/README2.md es/speakbook/README.md 

node .scripts/apply-po-to-md.js res/lang/SpeakBook_French.po fr/speakbook/README.md > fr/speakbook/README2.md && mv fr/speakbook/README2.md fr/speakbook/README.md 

node .scripts/apply-po-to-md.js res/lang/SpeakBook_Portuguese.po po/speakbook/README.md > po/speakbook/README2.md && mv po/speakbook/README2.md po/speakbook/README.md 

node .scripts/apply-po-to-md.js res/lang/SpeakBook_Swedish.po sv/speakbook/README.md > sv/speakbook/README2.md && mv sv/speakbook/README2.md sv/speakbook/README.md
