  <h2>Printing Instructions</h2>
  <p>How to get Speakbook printed – or how to make it yourself.</p>
  <h3>Sizing</h3>
  <p>The Speakbook is designed to be printed on A4 paper.  However, all Speakbook PDFs are sizable.  This means that although it is nominally an A4 document, you can print it on any size paper. </p>
  <p>If you want the Speakbook to be small and portable, you might decide to print it on A5 paper.  Note that at A5 size, you and your communication partner will need to sit closer together so that you can both see the smaller font.  Using a fine pen will help the text to be clearer.  Before printing a full pocket sized Speakbook, we would recommend that you print the training page (pages 24 and 25 of the PDF) at this smaller size, cut out the hole and test it with your partner before you print the complete book.</p>
  <p>You could also scale up and produce an A3 sized Speakbook.  Again, we would suggest you try out the training page (24 and 25) at A3 size before printing the complete bo Speakbook is copyright (©2011 Patrick Joyce) but you may download and print as many copies as you like free of charge.

  <h3>Professional printing</h3>
  <p>We recommend that the Speakbook is printed at a professional printing shop.  When sourcing a printing shop, check whether they offer wire binding.  Wire binding is important because it allows the book to open right back on itself and keeps everything aligned.</p>
<p>Once the book has been printed, you will need to cut out the holes in the centre of the pages and cut round the tabs.  A craft knife or sharp scissors can be used.</p>
<p>The following text could be used to get a quote from a printing shop:
</p>
  <div class="my-3"></div>
  <p>Dear Sir/Madam</p>
  <p>Could you please quote me for printing a copy of the attached PDF.  It is an A4 document and should be printed double sided.  Page 1 of the PDF is the outside of the front cover, Page 2 is the inside of that cover, etc.  It needs to be printed on stiff card with a shiny, laminate-type surface (it must be possible to write on the card using a non-permanent whiteboard pen and to wipe the ink off multiple times).  The document should then be wirebound down the left-hand edge so that it can open 360 degrees.  I will trim out the tabs and the holes in the middle of the pages.</p>

  <h3>Making Speakbook yourself</h3>
  <p>Depending on what technology you have access to, there are different ways of going about making your own Speakbook.</p>
  <h4>No technology!</h4>
  <p>You could copy out Speakbook by hand.</p>
  <h4>Home Printer</h4>
  <p>If you have a printer, then print the Speakbook onto card.  Paper will do, especially if you can laminate it, but card results in stiffer pages that make the book easier to use.  Print the book double sided – Page 1 of the PDF is the outside of the front cover, Page 2 is the inside of that cover, etc.  Most home printers will allow this – it might be called duplex or double sided printing.  Try the printer’s help files if you get stuck or look online for instructions.  If double sided printing isn’t possible, just print each page on an individual sheet and then glue them back to back.

After you have printed the Speakbook, cut out the central holes and round the tabs using a craft knife or sharp scissors.

If you have a laminator, move on to the next step.  Otherwise write your phrases in pencil to enable them to be rubbed out.  
</p>
  <h4>Laminating</h4>
  <p>Laminating Speakbook enables you to easily alter the words and phrases.  You can write on the laminated surface with a non permanent whiteboard pen and wipe it off with a damp cloth.  The text on the tabs might need to be written in permanent pen to stop it rubbing off.  

Once you have laminated the Speakbook, you will again need to cut out the central holes and round the tabs using a craft knife or sharp scissors.
</p>
  <h4>Cutting out the holes</h4>
  <p>Cut out the holes in the pages, and the tabs using scissors and/or a craft knife.</p>
  <h4>Binding</h4>
  <p>Once printed, the Speakbook pages will need to be bound together.  

The best binding for Speakbook is wire binding.  It keeps the pages together neatly and the central holes perfectly lined up.  It also allows the book to open right back on itself.

However, you are unlikely to have wire binding facilities at home!  Instead, you could punch holes down the left-hand edge of the book and hold it together with small loose leaf metal binding rings, treasury tags or string.  Make sure you punch holes near the corners as well as in the middle to keep it all aligned.
